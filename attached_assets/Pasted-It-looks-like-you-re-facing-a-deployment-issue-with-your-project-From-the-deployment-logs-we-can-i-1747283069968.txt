It looks like you're facing a deployment issue with your project. From the deployment logs, we can identify a couple of potential reasons for the failure, such as a syntax error in your TypeScript code and an incomplete try-catch block.

Here are steps you can take to address the issues:
Fix the Syntax Error:

You have a missing set of curly braces within your try-catch block in PlacesAutocomplete.tsx. The lines that update the internal value and invoke the callback should be inside the try block.
Complete the Catch Block:

Ensure all your try-catch statements are complete and correctly implemented, especially in sections handling cleanup.
Suggested Code Changes
Below are the changes you should make to the client/src/components/ui/PlacesAutocomplete.tsx file:

// Change 1: Fix the syntax error by properly closing the try block
try {
  listener = autocomplete.addListener('place_changed', placeChangedHandler);
  
  // Aggiorna prima il valore interno per mostrarlo nell'input
  setInternalValue(valueToUse);
  
  // Invoca il callback onChange con il valore e i dettagli
} catch (addListenerErr) {
  console.error('[PlacesAutocomplete] Error adding place_changed listener:', addListenerErr);
}
// Change 4: Fix the incomplete catch block in the container cleanup code
try {
  if (container && container.parentNode) {
    container.parentNode.removeChild(container);
  }
} catch (e) {
  // Ignoriamo errori specifici di rimozione
}
Additional Recommendations
After you make the above changes, please check to ensure your development dependencies are available. If necessary, consider including them during deployment by setting the environment variable REPLIT_KEEP_PACKAGE_DEV_DEPENDENCIES = "1" in the .replit file.

Make sure your application is listening on 0.0.0.0 to ensure that it's accessible from external ports and that your server is set to run at internal port 3000 for it to be forwarded correctly.

Once youâ€™ve implemented these changes, try redeploying your application. If any new errors occur, take a look at the logs again, and I can help you troubleshoot further.
