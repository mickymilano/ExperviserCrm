The “Synergy Contacts” field in the Deal form must be a true type-ahead autocomplete that reads directly from the Contacts table — it must NOT preload all contacts or use a static dropdown. It must:

1. **Async Search**  
   • On each keystroke (after 2+ characters), call `GET /api/contacts?search=<term>` to retrieve matching contacts from the contacts table.  
   • Exclude any contacts that are already directly related (affiliated) to the current Company; do not show them in results.

2. **Multi-Select**  
   • Allow selecting one or more contacts; selected contacts remain in the input as chips/tags.  
   • Under the hood, bind these to a form field `synergyContactIds: number[]`.

3. **Persistence**  
   • On Deal save, after you POST/PATCH the Deal itself, call `POST /api/deals/:id/synergies` with `{ contactIds: synergyContactIds }`.  
   • Do not allow creating Synergies anywhere except in the Deal form.

4. **Display**  
   • In the Deal detail page, render a “Synergies” section listing each selected contact with basic info (name, role) and a link to the Deal that created it.  
   • In the Company detail page, under a “Synergies” tab or card, list all synergy contacts from all Deals for that Company, grouping by Deal (Deal name + link).  
   • In the Contact detail page, under “Synergies,” list each Company + Deal where this contact was chosen as a synergy, with links.

5. **No Deletion from Synergies Page**  
   • Remove any “delete” or “remove” actions from the Synergies views. Synergies can only be removed by editing the originating Deal.

6. **Cleanup**  
   • Remove from the system any false “Business Synergy” relationships Replit previously generated in Company records.  
   • Ensure the only persistent connections in `synergy_contacts` are those created via valid Deal saves.

7. **Full Debug & Auto-Fix**  
   • After implementing the above, perform an end-to-end debug of every CRM function (Contacts, Companies, Deals, Leads, Tasks, Calendar, Email, Synergies).  
   • Detect and resolve all errors automatically according to the CRM specifications you already know.  
   • Do not prompt me again until **every** bug is fixed and the core CRM functionality works perfectly.  
   • Temporarily de-prioritize UI polish; focus on making every backend and form integration functionally correct per spec.

Paste this as a single prompt into your Replit AI assistant and execute it in one pass. When complete, report:  
“All Synergy Contacts autocomplete, persistence, display, cleanup and full system debug completed per spec.”
